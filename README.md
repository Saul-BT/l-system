# L-System

A fractal generator which uses [L-System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system) and basic commands inpired by the [logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)) ones.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

L-System uses the ecmascript 6 modules so in order to run it on your local machine you will have to install a web server (like [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/)).
